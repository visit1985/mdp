***How to get started:***

mdp needs the ncursesw headers to compile.
So make sure you have them installed:

- on Raspbian (Raspberry Pi) you need `libncurses5-dev` and `libncursesw5-dev`
- on Fedora you need `ncurses-devel` and `ncurses-c++-libs`

Now download and install mdp:

    $ git clone https://github.com/visit1985/mdp.git
    $ cd mdp
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ mdp sample.md

- On Arch Linux, you can use the existing [package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mdp/).
- on Cygwin you can use the existing [package](https://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-grep.cgi?grep=mdp.exe) from the setup program.
- On Debian, you can use the existing [DEB package](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mdp-src), or run `apt-get install mdp`.
- On FreeBSD, you can use the port [misc/mdp](http://www.freshports.org/misc/mdp).
- On MacOS, use either the [Homebrew Formula](http://brewformulas.org/Mdp) by running `brew install mdp` or install with [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/mdp/) with `sudo port install mdp`.
- On Slackware, grab the SlackBuild here: (http://slackbuilds.org/apps/mdp/), or run `sbopkg -i mdp`.
- On Ubuntu, you can use the existing [DEB package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mdp-src), or run `apt-get install mdp`.

Most terminals support 256 colors only if the TERM variable is
set correctly. To enjoy mdp's color fading feature:

    $ export TERM=xterm-256color

***How to use it:***

Horizontal rulers are used as slide separator.

- line wide markup
    - headlines
    - code
    - quotes
    - unordered list

- in-line markup
    - bold text
    - underlined text
    - code

Supports headers prefixed by @ symbol.

- first two header lines are displayed as title and author
    in top and bottom bar

Review sample.md for more details.

***Default controls:***

- h, j, k, l, Arrow keys,
    Space, Enter, Backspace,
    Page Up, Page Down - next/previous slide
- Home, g - go to first slide
- End, G - go to last slide
- 1-9 - go to slide n
- r - reload input file
- q - exit

***Configuration***:

A `config.h` configuration file is available in `include/`, change the settings you want and recompile.
Colors, keybindings and list types are configurable as of now. Note that configuring colors only works in 8 color mode.

***How to debug it:***

To make a debug version of `mdp`, just type:

    $ make DEBUG=1

***Convert to PDF:***

- Install `md2pdf` by obtaining the [release](https://github.com/mandolyte/mdtopdf/releases) for your arch and OS or, if
  you have `go` installed, invoke:

```sh
$ go install github.com/mandolyte/mdtopdf/cmd/md2pdf@latest
```
- If you require syntax highlighting, download the [gohighlight lexers](https://github.com/jessp01/gohighlight/tree/master/syntax_files)

`md2pdf` supports all major `mdp` features and accepts local files, remote HTTP(s) URL and `STDIN` inputs.
The below command will convert an `mdp` compatible markdown file to a PDF with a dark theme,
syntax highlighting (you'll need to provide the language hint, of course), page/slide separation and a footer:

```sh
md2pdf -i https://github.com/jessp01/crash-course-in/raw/main/courses/apt_dpkg_deb/apt_dpkg_deb.md \
    -o apt_dpkg_deb.pdf \
    -s ~/.config/zaje/syntax_files \
    --theme dark \
    --new-page-on-hr \
    --with-footer \
    --author "Jesse Portnoy <jesse@packaman.io>" \
    --title "A crash course on handling deb packages"
```

Since `markdown` does not support the centering escape sequences (i.e: `->` and `<-`), you will want to remove these before converting, for example:

```sh
$ sed 's@^->\s*\(#.*\)\s*<-@\1@g' sample.md | ~/go/bin/md2pdf -o mdp.pdf \
    --theme dark --new-page-on-hr
```
